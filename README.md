# Project: Hive Box
## Introduction


[DevOps Hive](https://devopshive.net/) master plan for **roadmap**, **mentorship**, and **bootcamp** to start a DevOps Engineer career in the Agile way!


Me, Ahmed Moustafa, a Junior DevOps Engineer will start implementing this project based on the [Roadmap](https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/dynamic-devops-roadmap/tree/main/projects/hivebox#approach).


The implementation will be as clean as possible and I will try to add more features and approaches more than in the project description.

## Approach

This project follows the same Dynamic MVP-style mindset used in the [roadmap](../../). Which aims to cover the whole Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). That mean each phase of this project will cover all aspects of the DevOps areas like planning, coding, containers, testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure, etc.

This project works the best in `Peering` mode where you have another person helps you whenever you stuck (like a mentor or so). But in case you don't have that, always back to the `Related Module` where it has more details could help you in the project.




## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a scalable RESTful API around [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) but customized to help beekeeper with their chores. The API output should be in JSON. You will start with a basic implementation, then extend the whole system to handles thousands of requests per second. But always remember, every decision has a cost.

You can get senseBox IDs by checking the [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) website. Use 3 senseBox IDs close to each other (you can use this one [5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786) as starting point). Just copy the IDs, you will need them in the next steps.

## Phase 1

- Understand your role in this project and how you work with other teams.

> This is a test 


- Brush up on your knowledge about Software Project management (Hint: [What is agile project management?](https://www.apm.org.uk/resources/find-a-resource/agile-project-management/) And [Introduction to Software Product Management](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-software-product-management)).

> This is a test 


- Decide which Agile methodology you will use. (Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, etc.).

> This is a test 


- Document as you go. Always assume that someone else will read your project at any phase.

> This is a test 



- Each change should be done in order and using pull requests (donâ€™t push directly to the main branch!).


> This is a test 



- Don't forget! You are [managers of one](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#managers-of-one)!
